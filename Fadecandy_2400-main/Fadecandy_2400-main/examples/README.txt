Fadecandy project PDE2400

### Simulator

The simulator consists of 360 LED's on 6 LED bars, 
the opc library is also imported which allows wireless access to 
the LED divice. The simulator allows us to view the animation before 
they are uploaded to the actual device.

The data is sent to localhost:7890 which will loopback to the device i am using 
as both programs will be running at the same time.

### Project Description

The aim of this project is to write code for multiple animations that can be
produced on 6 LED bars. The development of the project should be submitted 
to a dedicated repository. The final version of the code should be demonstrated 
as a video file.

During this project i misunderstood the idea of using a GUI to achieve 
a higher grade and assumed it to be code that allows user input within
the code. so for the future i would like to implement Tkinter. 

### Code

The user is asked to choose a letter from 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' or 'e',
once a letter is selected the animation assigned to the string value will run.
The user input is placed in a while loop so it can indefinetley ask the user 
to select an animation to play rather than running the program continuously.
